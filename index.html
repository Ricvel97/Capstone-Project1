    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My name is
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ricardo.velasco.334">Ricardo Velasco</a
      >, I'm 27 years old and I currently live in Venezuela. I'm a M.D graduated
      in 2022 in LUZ university, located in my current city, Maracaibo. I've
      been exploring the complex, but also fascinating world of programming
      since January of the current year.
      <strong>My goal is to be a Front End developer</strong>, it's a branch of
      web develoment that's really fascinated me, as since I was younger, I
      always wanted to know how Websites were developed and how Internet worked.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I started studying Medicine at LUZ university in 2014 and graduated in
      2022. All of those years were exclusively dedicated to my career, however,
      I've been dedicated most of my time to programming since January of the
      current year (2024).
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been chess player since I was a 10 years old, as you might know,
      chess is a game where deep thinking and calculation is required. All of
      this have given me the capacity of being very
      <strong>analytic</strong> and <strong>responsible</strong>
      with all the tasks I'm asked to do.
    </p>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <p>
      I currently have no experience in previous works related to programming,
      but I'm very open to learn as much as possible in any kind of job related
      to Front-End. Obviously, I have worked as a Doctor in different practices,
      where I have obtained different skills that can be really helpful in a
      completely different sector as it can be programming.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      My previous work as a Doctor has given me different skills over the years.
      For me, one of the most important have been being able to work under big
      pressure due to the constant emergencies and issues that you as a Doctor
      must solve in short time. Besides, having to act quickly have resulted in
      a quick thought-process.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my teenage, I started playing chess when I was 10 years old, it
      occuppied most of my time during my childhood. After a very hard training
      and intense study sessions, I was able to be the nation champion of
      Venezuela in different categories throughout the years. I represented
      Venezuela internationally several times, and my biggest goal was to win a
      national championship with my state team when I was 14 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all of this, these are some of the skills I've developed over the
      years:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Capable of working under pressure</li>
      <li>Quick thought process</li>
      <li>Very responsible and organized</li>
      <li>Disciplined and attentive to details</li>
    </ul>
